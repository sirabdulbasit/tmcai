# Build log — written by Claude, read by Codex

One `## Iteration N` section per build turn, appended, newest at the bottom.
Codex reviews these entries against the real diff, so a claim here that the diff
does not support is the single most useful thing for the reviewer to catch.

Required per iteration: what the fix queue said, what was changed and why, the
verification numbers (tsc / vitest, exact figures), what was NOT done, and the
honest expectation of which criterion should move.

## Iteration 1 — 2026-08-18

**Mode / scope.** The brief carries three competing instructions (clear a deck tag ·
build the dispatcher gap · CAMPAIGN SUSPENDED, only job = make HEAD deployable). The
campaign section governs, as it has every turn since the 2026-08-14 owner ruling that an
iteration is deployed before the next one starts. Its data is stale, though: it says 1
undeployed commit (`6057c9d`); the truth at turn start was **12 commits** between
deployed `6416743` and HEAD `d324488` — my five (DEF-230, DEF-231 + docs) plus seven
orchestrator deck/loop commits.

**What actually blocked release this turn.** The matrix at HEAD `d324488` was RED:
`npx vitest run` → **1 failed | 2791 passed**. The failure was
`tests/orchestratorPulseRoute.test.ts` — the contract test that executes the real
`scripts/orchestrator/pulse.py --json` — still pinning the old five-phase list, while
the orchestrator's own commits (`8964dbb` "two pulse kinds", `0629bfd`, `a0358ed`)
redesigned the pulse: `PHASE_ORDER_CONVERSATIONAL = ["Chat Analysis", "Build & Deploy"]`
vs `PHASE_ORDER_EVALUATION` (five), selected by `state/pulse-mode`, which is currently
`conversational`. So the one release blocker was a superseded test assertion, and closing
it is precisely this turn's job.

**Change.** `server/tests/orchestratorPulseRoute.test.ts:171-189` — the phase-name
assertion now pins the contract PER MODE, against the `pulse_mode` the collector itself
reports: `conversational` → `['Chat Analysis', 'Build & Deploy']`, otherwise the five
evaluation phases; plus `expect(['conversational','evaluation']).toContain(d.pulse_mode)`.
Why this is the mechanism: the panel reads phase names verbatim, so the test must fail on
a rename — but it must not fail because the box happens to be mid-conversational-pulse
when vitest runs. Pinning against the collector's own reported mode keeps the test
deterministic across mode changes while still catching every rename in either list.
`pulse.py` itself is untouched (forbidden path, and correct — the redesign is the
orchestrator's intent; the test was the stale side).

**Verification (after the last edit, from `server/`):**
- `npx tsc --noEmit` → exit **0** (via the committed `server/.npmrc`, DEF-231)
- `npx vitest run` → **223 passed | 1 skipped** files; **2792 passed | 0 failed**
  (7 expected fail | 21 skipped | 1 todo, of 2821)
- `git diff --check` → clean
- `npm run build` was NOT run in this tree — `server/dist` is `chattr +i` and is the
  deployed artifact (CLAUDE.md). Build verification stands on the clean-clone build at
  `ec8ed31` (exit 0, artifact verified). Every commit since (`92917bb..d324488` and this
  one) touches no `server/src` file — verified with `git diff --name-only` — so the
  emitted artifact identity is unchanged. `--noEmit` is the build check.

**CAPABILITY:** RELIABILITY-ONLY
**PREDICTED:** +0
**MECHANISM:** a superseded harness-contract test made the release gate red at HEAD;
updating the pin to the redesigned two-mode contract restores a green matrix. Nothing
the owner receives changes.
**FALSIFIER:** the deploy phase still reads vitest RED at this HEAD; or the next
evaluation-mode pulse emits five phases and this test fails on it.

**Governing-docs verdict.** Neither *progressing* nor *circling* in the Brain sense: no
owner-visible Brain behaviour changed, so no DEF row and no symptom tag. This is the
supersedure pattern (DEF-226/DEF-165 precedent): the code moved by design, the test was
the stale half. No chat-archive entry is warranted — no owner conversation reported this.

**What I did NOT do, and say so plainly:**
- **No deck tag closed** (`whatsapp-ptt-media-not-ready`, `stale-signoff`,
  `wrong-from-account`) — the campaign section forbids new work while the deploy debt
  stands. What was done instead: the release blocker on that very debt.
- **The dispatcher gap was NOT built**, though I re-verified it live at HEAD this turn
  and it is real: `DISPATCHABLE_PLAN_STEP_KINDS` (`brainComposer.ts:184`) omits
  `mark_open_item_done`, `remove_open_item`, `record_preference`, all three present in
  `IMMEDIATE_INTERNAL_ACTION_TYPES` (`brainComposer.ts:211-223`); the rejection fires on
  the confirmed-plan path. The chat analyst's reading is confirmed — same kind
  executable on one path, rejected on the other (`protection-with-two-implementations`).
  This is the first build after the debt clears, and it must unify the sets, not patch
  `remove_open_item` alone.
- **I did not deploy** (forbidden; D-22 — the orchestrator deploys by hand).

**The real obstacle, named.** Deployed-sha has been `6416743` all session while 13
deployable commits accumulated. The work is not reaching production because the deploy
phase has not run — that is the finding. HEAD is green under the exact documented
matrix commands as of this entry; nothing in the tree blocks `deploy.sh`.

**Honest prediction.** No criterion moves from this change (it is test-only). What would
prove me wrong: any benchmark case moving more than noise, which would mean this entry
misattributed something. The prediction that matters: after deploy, the owner's next
"delete all actionable items" turn still fails with the dispatcher string — until the
set-unification build above ships.
